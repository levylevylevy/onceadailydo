# Once a Daily Do

Once a Daily Do was my team's submission for HopHacks 2020. Once a Daily Do suggests daily
activities because in the times of COVID-19, many people have been pushed away from their normal
routines. As a result, more people than usual are battling with symptoms of depression. Depression
often manifests itself as a lack of energy to do anything; our app tries to provide simple
activities that anyone can do to re-gain momentum in life. For more details about our app's purpose,
see our [Devpost Submission](devpost.com/software/once-a-daily-do).
